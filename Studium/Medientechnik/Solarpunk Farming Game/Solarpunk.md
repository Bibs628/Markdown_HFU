>As a [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") [literary subgenre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_genre "Literary genre") and [art movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_movement "Art movement"), solarpunk works to address how the future might look if humanity succeeded in solving major contemporary challenges with an emphasis on sustainability, [human impact on the environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment "Human impact on the environment"), and addressing [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change") and [pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution "Pollution"). Especially as a subgenre, it is aligned with [cyberpunk derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_derivatives "Cyberpunk derivatives"), and may borrow elements from [utopian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopian_and_dystopian_fiction "Utopian and dystopian fiction") and [fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy "Fantasy") genres.[[6]]

>Solarpunk serves as a foil to the cyberpunk genre, particularly within the fashion industry. Both genres create and consolidate post-industrial countercultures; Solarpunk incites rebellion through its depiction of protoenvironmental socioecological relationships, whereas Cyberpunk advances the theme of rebellion through detached secondary environments, which often takes place in tangible dataspheres, virtual landscapes, and dystopian urban environments. Solarpunk draws inspiration from [Bohemian style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_style "Bohemian style"). The convergence of environmentalism and art serve as a framework for both subgenres. Solarpunk's interpretation of social collectivism strongly contrasts the individuality of Bohemian counterculture; Solarpunk recognizes individuality as an integral component of [progressivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism "Progressivism") and identifies sociocultural distinctions as an impetus for change, though Solarpunk encompasses these elements within the greater socioecological scaffolding in a manner that contrasts the Bohemian assertion that individuality alone acts as the sole impetus for change. 9)
